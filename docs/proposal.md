# Simon Says AI Coach - Written Proposal

## The Problem

Modern professionals face three critical productivity challenges:

1. **Generic advice overload** - Productivity content treats everyone the same, ignoring individual work styles and contexts
2. **Scattered coaching resources** - Users toggle between task management apps, wellness apps, and self-help content without integrated guidance
3. **Lack of personalized accountability** - Traditional productivity tools track tasks but don't understand *why* you're stuck or *how* to help you move forward

**The gap**: People need coaching that adapts to their specific situation, personality, and goals in real-time - not one-size-fits-all templates or static advice.

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- **Knowledge workers** (25-45 years old) who struggle with focus, prioritization, or burnout

### User Personas

**"Overwhelmed Olivia"** - Product manager juggling multiple projects, needs help prioritizing and managing energy
- Pain point: Too many competing priorities, unclear how to say no
- Value: Strategic framework for decision-making and time-blocking

**"Blocked Ben"** - Designer experiencing creative blocks and imposter syndrome

- Value: Structured creative exercises and permission to experiment

**"Burnout Brenda"** - Startup founder working 80-hour weeks, losing passion
- Pain point: Can't stop hustling, guilt about rest
- Value: Sustainable systems and recovery protocols
