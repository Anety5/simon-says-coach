# Developer Biography

## About the Creator

**Annette** - Solo Founder & Full-Stack Developer

I'm an independent software developer passionate about building tools that help people work smarter, not harder. With a background in product design and engineering, I've spent years exploring how technology can augment human productivity without adding complexity or overwhelm.

## Background & Experience

### Technical Skills
- **Full-stack development**: React Native, Node.js, Python
- **Mobile & web**: Cross-platform development with Expo, responsive design
- **AI integration**: Prompt engineering, LLM API implementation (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini)
- **Cloud infrastructure**: Firebase, AWS, serverless architectures
- **Monetization**: RevenueCat, Stripe, freemium product strategy

### Product Philosophy
I believe the best productivity tools don't just track what you do - they understand *why* you're stuck and help you move forward. Generic advice doesn't work because everyone's context is different. That's why I built Simon Says AI Coach with 6 specialized personalities that adapt to your work style, goals, and preferences.

## Why I Built Simon Says

The idea came from my own struggle with productivity advice overload. I'd read books on time management, try new task apps, follow productivity YouTubers - but nothing stuck. The advice was either too generic ("just focus!") or too rigid (forcing a specific system).

I realized what I needed wasn't *more* advice, but **contextual coaching** - someone who could meet me where I was, understand my specific challenge, and give me actionable next steps based on my situation.

When I experimented with AI chatbots like ChatGPT, I saw the potential - but they lacked consistency and coaching methodology. Every conversation started from scratch. I wanted persistent context, specialized expertise, and a UX designed for habit formation.

**Simon Says AI Coach** is the tool I wished existed: 6 expert coaches in your pocket, available 24/7, adapting to your needs in real-time.

## What I Learned Building This

1. **Prompt engineering is a craft** - Each coach personality required 20+ iterations to get the tone and methodology right
2. **Freemium balance is hard** - Too restrictive and users churn, too generous and nobody converts
3. **Voice UX changes everything** - Text feels like work, voice feels like conversation
4. **Mobile-first matters** - People need coaching when they're stuck, not when they're at a desk
5. **Multimodal is the future** - Being able to upload a screenshot and say "help me fix this" is magical

## Tech Challenges Solved

- **API resilience**: Implemented exponential backoff with jitter to handle rate limits gracefully
- **Cross-platform voice**: Web Speech API works differently across browsers - built fallback detection
- **Firebase security**: Crafted rules that allow anonymous auth while protecting user data
- **Freemium metering**: Daily message limits that reset cleanly across time zones
- **Context compression**: Balancing conversation history depth with API token costs

## Vision for the Future

Simon Says is just the beginning. I envision a world where:
- **AI coaching is ubiquitous** - Everyone has access to personalized guidance, not just executives who can afford $500/hour coaches
- **Mental models are shareable** - The productivity frameworks inside each coach can be remixed and contributed by the community
- **Teams coach together** - Shared coaching sessions where the AI helps teams align on priorities and resolve conflicts
- **Your coach knows you better than you know yourself** - Longitudinal data analysis spots burnout patterns before you do

## Beyond Simon Says

I'm fascinated by **AI-augmented productivity** and **human-centered design**. Previous projects include:
- A habit tracker that uses spaced repetition to reinforce positive behaviors
- A Notion template marketplace for solopreneurs
- Open-source contribution to React Native accessibility tooling
